# Lithium-Ion-Battery-Charger-with-Active-Cell-Balancing-Flyback-Converter

This project focuses on designing and implementing a **Battery Management System (BMS)** for a 3-cell Li-ion battery pack. The system uses an **isolated Flyback DC‚ÄìDC converter** with **active cell balancing**, **CC‚ÄìCV charging strategy**, and a **PID-based control loop** implemented on an Arduino platform.

## Introduction
Battery Management Systems (BMS) are critical for the safe and optimal operation of battery packs, especially in electric vehicles (EVs). Early BMS designs provided basic monitoring and protection; modern systems now include advanced features like state-of-charge (SoC) estimation, state-of-health (SoH) monitoring, and cell balancing. These functionalities prevent individual cell overloading, thus enhancing safety and performance.
